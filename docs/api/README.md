The Mayara API has changed over time. The current server implements the v1 API (which is simple and minimal) as well as the v3 API (which tries to be as much like Signal K as possible.)

The V3 api is the best API for new clients/customers of Mayara.

It uses Signal K format for both REST and stream (websockets). Both full and delta data will be supported.
