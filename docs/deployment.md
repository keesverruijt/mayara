### How to deploy (install) mayara

The mayara server needs to run on a computer with at least 32 MB free disk and 32 free RAM, that has a wired connection to the radar. Clients can connect to the mayara server over WiFi.

There are pre-built binary images for the following platforms:

- Microsoft Windows on x86_64
- Apple MacOS on Apple Silicon
- Linux on x86_64
- Linux on aarch64

The latter supports the smallest computers, like a Raspberry 3B or better, and various internet routers such as the GL-iNet B1300.

## Docker/Podman

TODO: We will also supply Docker/Podman images for x86_64 and aarch64.

TODO: Explain how to download and most importantly, set up networking so that it works.
