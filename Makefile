# Mayara Build System
#
# GUI is downloaded from npm (@marineyachtradar/mayara-gui) during build.
# For GUI development, clone mayara-gui repo as sibling and use 'make dev'.
#
# Usage:
#   make          - Build release with docs (recommended)
#   make release  - Build release with docs
#   make debug    - Build debug with docs
#   make dev      - Build debug with live GUI reload (requires ../mayara-gui)
#   make docs     - Generate rustdoc only
#   make run      - Build and run server
#   make run-dev  - Build and run dev server (live GUI reload)
#   make mpi      - Build for linux and deploy and run on merrimac-pi
#   make clean    - Clean build artifacts
