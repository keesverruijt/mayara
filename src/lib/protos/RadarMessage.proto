/*
 * The data stream coming from a radar is a series of spokes.
 * The number of spokes per revolution is different for each type of
 * radar and can be found in the radar specification found at
 * .../v1/api/radars as 'spokes_per_revolution' or .../v3/api/radar/{id}/capabilities
 * The maximum length of each spoke is also defined there, as well as the legend that provides
 * a lookup table for each byte of data in the spoke.
 *
 * The angle and bearing fields below are in terms of spokes, so
 * range from [0..spokes_per_revolution>.
 *
 * Angle is a mandatory field and tells you the rotation of the spoke
 * relative to the front of the boat, going clockwise. 0 means directly
 * ahead, spokes_per_revolution / 4 is to starboard, spokes_per_revolution / 2 is directly astern, etc.
 *
 * Bearing, if set, means that either the radar or the radar server has
 * enriched the data with a true bearing, e.g. 0 is directly North,
 * spokes_per_revolution / 4 is directly West, spokes_per_revolution / 2 is South, etc.
 *
 * Likewise, time and lat/lon indicate the best effort when the spoke
 * was generated, and the lat/lon of the radar at the time of generation.
